Grassroots Innovation Taxonomy Repository

NIF-Aligned Local Innovation Classification Framework

Overview

The Grassroots Innovation Taxonomy Repository is a structured classification framework designed to identify, document, and organize undocumented grassroots innovations. It aligns with National Innovation Foundation (NIF) criteria to make informal, community-driven solutions visible, searchable, verifiable, and fundable.

This repository transforms invisible local ingenuity into structured knowledge that can be accessed by researchers, policymakers, development organizations, and impact investors.

Purpose

Grassroots innovators often create practical solutions to real-world problems, but these innovations remain undocumented and unsupported. This taxonomy provides a standardized system to:

Classify grassroots innovations using consistent criteria

Enable discovery and validation of local solutions

Support funding, incubation, and scaling opportunities

Preserve indigenous and community knowledge

Bridge the gap between informal innovation and formal innovation systems

Alignment with National Innovation Foundation (NIF)

This framework is designed to align with core NIF evaluation principles, including:

Novelty and originality

Practical utility

Social and economic impact

Sustainability

Replicability and scalability

Grassroots origin and community relevance
